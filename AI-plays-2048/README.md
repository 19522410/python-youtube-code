# AI plays 2048

In this project, we develop AI that can play the game 2048 (extremely well) using [Monte Carlo tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search). Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE_oAQ5FzMk) for a link to the YouTube video.

In another project, we explain how to build 2048 from scratch. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4XP2IcI-Bg) for a link to that video; click [here]() for that GitHub repo.
